### Description

This workshop focussed on recent advances in software tools for modeling neurons 
and neuronal networks at different levels of resolution. Neuroscience has been experiencing 
a rapid growth of data streams characterizing composition, connectivity, and activity 
of brain networks in ever increasing details. Data-driven modeling will be essential 
to integrate these multimodal and complex data into predictive simulations to advance our 
understanding of brain function and mechanisms. We brought together representatives of 
many teams that develop computational tools aimed at incorporating and simulating this complexity. 

Major topics for discussion included the established and emerging computational approaches for 
building and simulating network models, advances in enabling increased access to sophisticated 
modeling for a broad community of users, and sharing and reproducibility of models. 
These discussions should serve to promote the efficiency, reproducibility, and free exchange of 
computational models in the community to support advances in many areas of neuroscience.
