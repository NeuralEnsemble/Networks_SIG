### Description

Many biophysical neuronal network simulations contain descriptions of structured connectivity 
between groups of neuronal elements (e.g. cells, populations, brain areas). These can be specified 
in many ways, often in formats quite closely tied to the simulatorâ€™s internal data model. 

Extracting these network descriptions, to allow the network structure to be visualised, analysed, 
shared, and importantly compared with other network models and anatomical data, is a key part of 
maximising their usefulness as scientific entities. 

While procedural creation of networks is common across all simulators (e.g. using Python scripts), 
there is still a need for a consensus on a declarative, compact, high level format for describing 
the properties of the networks (i.e. a reusable template for generating instances of the network) 
which encapsulates the essential biologically relevant features of the modelled system. 

This workshop will gather together developers of simulators and interoperability formats to:

- Gather information on existing (internal) formats being used by simulators for defining network structures
- Discuss initiatives to make cross simulator formats for exchanging network specifications
- Decide on future plans to minimise repetition of work, ensure interoperability and maximise usability and accessibility of the formats for end users

This workshop is organised as part of the [INCF Special Interest Group (SIG) on Standardised Representations of Network Structures](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/Networks_SIG).
